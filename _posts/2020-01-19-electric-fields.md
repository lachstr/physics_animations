An electron remains trapped in a potential energy well. If it were to aquire slightly more kinetic energy the electron would travel to infinity.

In this situation we consider the electric field observed at a region in space as a like-charged ring approaches passes co-centrically with our point of observation. The simulation starts and ends when the ring is equi-distant away from our position.
