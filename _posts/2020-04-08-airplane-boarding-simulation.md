Here we will investigate a modified version of the well known 100 passenger plane boarding problem.

Let's consider the following scenario;

There are 100 passengers about to board a plane. 

The first passenger to board sits in someone elses seat

Each following passenger;

- Sits in their assigned seat if it is avaliable
- Otherwise, randomly chooses an avaliable seat

You are the 100th passenger to board the plane, what is the probability that you are able to sit in your assigned seat?

We could attempt to simulate the event with a function like this;

We'll generalise the scenario for a number of passengers equal to `plane_size`

```python
import numpy as np
import random 

def last_passenger_sits_in_assigned_seat(plane_size):
    plane = {}
    
    for seat_number in range(plane_size):
        plane[seat_number] = 'empty'
        
    passengers = [i for i in range(plane_size)]
    random.shuffle(passengers)
    
    ## Sit the first passenger in the wrong seat
    while (rand_wrong_seat := random.randint(0, plane_size-1)) == passengers[0]:
        pass
        ## Pick another random seat which isnt the assigned one

    plane[rand_wrong_seat] = 'taken'
    
    ## Seat the 2nd to 2nd last passengers according to logic above
    for passenger in passengers[1:-1]:
        if plane[passenger] == 'empty':
            ## This passenger can sit in their assigned seat
            plane[passenger] = 'taken'
        else:
            ## Someone is sitting in this passenger's seat, 
            ## find a random empty seat for them.
            seats = list(plane.items())
            random.shuffle(seats)
            for seat_number, avaliability in seats:
                if avaliability == 'empty':
                    plane[seat_number] = 'taken'
                    break
                    
    ## Check to see if the last passenger has thier seat
    if plane[passengers[-1]] == 'empty':
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

[Adding some print statements]({{site.baseurl}}/jupyter/board_plane_actual.py) to the function we can ensure it works correctly.

```python
In[32] last_passenger_sits_in_assigned_seat(plane_size=10)
```
```
Passenger 7 sits in seat 5
Passenger with seat 1 sits in their assigned seat
Passenger with seat 9 sits in their assigned seat
Passenger with seat 8 sits in their assigned seat
Passenger with seat 0 sits in their assigned seat
Passenger with seat 3 sits in their assigned seat
Passenger with seat 6 sits in their assigned seat
Passenger with seat 5 sits in seat 4
Passenger with seat 2 sits in their assigned seat
```
```python
Out[32] False
```
Great! We've simulated a plane boarding event for a 10 passenger plane and found the last passenger was not able to sit in their assigned seat. Calling the function again would likely result in different output.

One interesting question to ask is;

Is the event that the last passenger sits in their assigned seat independent of the size of the plane?

We could be clever about it and construct a mathematical proof. However, such things are too difficult for the computer scientist. Alas, we shall simulate such events. This has the advantage of being applicable when the situation is more complicated and a proof cannot be demonstrated.

We'll simulate boarding planes of size 10, 30, 60, 100, 150, 200 once on each day of the month, compute the experimental probability that the last passenger was able to sit in their assigned seat that month, then repeat this process for 100 years (1200 months). 

```python
resulting_prob = {}

plane_sizes = [10, 30, 60, 100, 150, 200]

for plane_size in plane_sizes:
    resulting_prob[plane_size] = []
    years = 100
    for months in range(12*years):
    
        able_to_sit_in_assigned_seat = 0
        
        for day in range(31):
            if (board_plane(plane_size)):
                able_to_sit_in_assigned_seat += 1
        
        probability_this_year = able_to_sit_in_assigned_seat/31
        
        resulting_prob[plane_size].append(probability_this_year)

import pandas

data = pandas.DataFrame(resulting_prob)
print(data)
```
```
           10        30        60        100       150       200

The pandas dataframe is abit difficult to visualise, so we can plot this data on a histogram.
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.title("100 Years of Plane Boarding")
plt.ylabel('Number of Months with Probability')
plt.xlabel('Probability Final Passenger has Assigned Seat')

from statistics import mean, stdev

for plane_size in plane_sizes:
    plt.hist(data[plane_size], label=f"""{plane_size} seat plane 
             μ={mean(data[plane_size]):.3f}
             σ={stdev(data[plane_size]):.3f}""")


plt.legend()
```
![plane_hist]({{ site.baseurl }}/jupyter/plane-hist.png)

Curiously, we do note that the 10 seat plane has a slightly lower probability than the others. Not so obvious? We can plot the mean probability as a function of plane size.

```python
for plane_size in plane_sizes:
    plt.plot(plane_size, mean(data[plane_size]), '.')

plt.xlabel('Plane Size')
plt.ylabel('Mean Probability Final Passenger has Assigned Seat')
```
![pln_mean]({{ site.baseurl }}/jupyter/meanprobvsplanesize.png)

Interesting indeed! 

It seems like the probability asymptotes to 0.5 as the plane size increases...

Our data is looking abit scarce, let's try doing the same experiement for another few hundred years and and a larger assortment of plane sizes...

- The larger assortment of plane sizes will make the pattern more obious to see
- The larger number of years will reduce the standard deviation for each point by a factor of the square root of the ratio increase

```python
resulting_prob = {}

plane_sizes = np.arange(10, 120, 5)

for plane_size in plane_sizes:
    resulting_prob[plane_size] = []

    years = 1000
    for months in range(12*years):
    
        able_to_sit_in_assigned_seat = 0
        
        for day in range(31):
            if (board_plane(plane_size)):
                able_to_sit_in_assigned_seat += 1
        
        probability_this_year = able_to_sit_in_assigned_seat/31
        
        resulting_prob[plane_size].append(probability_this_year)

data = pandas.DataFrame(resulting_prob)

for plane_size in plane_sizes:
    plt.plot(plane_size, mean(data[plane_size]), '.')

plt.xlabel('Plane Size')
plt.ylabel('Mean Probability Final Passenger has Assigned Seat')
```
![pln_mean]({{ site.baseurl }}/jupyter/meanprobvsplanesize-manyplanes.png)

Beautiful!

It seems that this occurs because we have *guaranteed* the first passenger sits in the wrong seat. This means that the first passenger *never* sits in the correct seat. This has a decreasing effect on the overall probability as the plane size increases - later we'll determine *precisely* what that means.

Instead let's modify our original function so that the passenger chooses a seat at random (meaning, they *may* sit in the correct seat.)

This is done by swapping out

```python
## Sit the first passenger in the wrong seat
while (rand_wrong_seat := random.randint(0, plane_size-1)) == passengers[0]:
    pass
    ## Pick another random seat which isnt the assigned 
plane[rand_wrong_seat] = 'taken'
```
with; 
```python
## Sit the first passenger in a random seat
rand_seat = random.randint(0, plane_size-1)
plane[rand_seat] = 'taken'
```

Calling running the same code that was used to produce the last plot gives

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/jupyter/meanprobvsplanesize-manyplanes-trulyrandom.png)

Which we can see seems independent of the plane size.
