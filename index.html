  <h2 class="page-heading">Pendulums</h2>

  <p>The matplotlib animator can give striking results.</p>

  <h3 class="page-heading">Real and Approximated</h3>
  	<p>Here we will examine qualitatively the applicabiltiy of the theta based model in modelling pendulum motion. Let's first consider releasing from an angle of &pi;/3. Can you tell the difference?</p>

	<p>No? Let's have a look at releasing from 2&pi;/3.<p>

	<p>Qualitatively, we deduce that the theta model does not match our intuition for how real pendulums behave at large angles.<p>

	<pre class="prettyprint">def real_pendulum_ode(conditions, t, ℓ=0.2, g=9.8):
    ##current state of θ and ω is in the conditions list
    θ, ω = conditions
    
    dydt = [ω, -g/ℓ*sin(θ)]
    return dydt</pre>

    <p>Solving the real system is as simple as calling <code>odeint(real_pendulum_ode, init_conditions, t_interval)</code>. Imagine doing such a calculation with pencil and paper!</p>




   <h2 class="page-heading">Electric Fields</h2>

   <p>An electron remains trapped in a potential energy well. If it were to aquire slightly more kinetic energy the electron would travel to infinity.</p>

	</video> 

	<p>In this situation we consider the electric field observed at a region in space as a like-charged ring approaches passes co-centrically with our point of observation. The simulation starts and ends when the ring is equi-distant away from our position.</p>
