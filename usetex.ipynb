    "workaround is to set ``ps.distiller.res`` to a higher value (perhaps 6000)\n",
    "in your rc settings, which will produce larger files but may look better and\n",
    "scale reasonably. A better workaround, which requires Poppler_ or Xpdf_, can be\n",
    "activated by changing the ``ps.usedistiller`` rc setting to ``xpdf``. This\n",
