    "Let the Standard Enthalpy of Formation be denoted as $Δ_fH^$. $Δ_fH^⦵$ for a given substance is the change in enthalpy during the formation of 1 mole of that substance from its constituent elements, with all substances in their standard states. The $⦵$ symbol indicidates the values were measured at $100.0$kPa and a given temperature $T$, usually $25°C = 298K$.\n",

    "- Gas: The hypothetical state it would have given it obeys the ideal gas equation at $100.0$ kPa. \n",
